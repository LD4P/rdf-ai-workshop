This workshop provides participants the opportunity to explore Sinopia's Linked Data resources 
through a machine-learning lens. 

-  The first part will focus on creating Panda's Dataframes of 
    RDF resources within a Jupyter notebook along with different ways to analyze and visualize the 
    triples and graphs accessed through Sinopia's API. 

-  The second part of the workshop will take 
   the created dataframes and investigate using a custom spaCy Named Entity Recognition pipeline
   for tagging descriptions with FAST subject headings. The last part will use HuggingFace 
   transformers for NER and summarization pipelines.  

-  The last part of the workshop will apply FastAI and PyTorch to the 
   dataframes for further exploration by the participants.
