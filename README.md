# LD4 02021 Conference
Presentation and source code for Jeremy Nelson's workshop, *Visualizing and Training Sinopia 
Linked Data with Pandas, spaCy, and PyTorch* at the 02021 LD4 Conference.

This workshop provides participants the opportunity to explore Sinopia's Linked Data resources 
through a machine-learning lens. 

-  The first part will focus on creating Panda's Dataframes of 
    RDF resources within a Jupyter notebook along with different ways to analyze and visualize the 
    triples and graphs accessed through Sinopia's API. 

-  The second part of the workshop will take 
   the created dataframes and investigate using a custom spaCy Named Entity Recognition pipeline
   for tagging descriptions with FAST subject headings. 

-  The last part of the workshop will apply PyTorch and HuggingFace transformers to the 
   dataframes for further exploration by the participants.
