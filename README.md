# RDF-AI Workshop
Presentation and source code for Jeremy Nelson's workshop, *Visualizing and Training Sinopia 
Linked Data with Pandas, spaCy, and PyTorch* at the 02021 and 02022 LD4 Conference.

This workshop provides participants the opportunity to explore [Sinopia's](https://sinopia.io) Linked Data 
resources through a machine-learning lens. 

-  Creating [Panda's](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Dataframes of 
   RDF resources within a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook along with different ways 
   to analyze and visualize the triples and graphs accessed through Sinopia's API. 

-  Taking the Siniopia dataframes and using a custom [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) Named Entity 
   Recognition (NER) pipeline, automatically tagging descriptions with FAST subject headings. 
   
-  Use [HuggingFace]() transformers for NER and summarization pipelines for Linked Data.  

-  Apply [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)  to the  dataframes for further exploration by the participants. 

-  Introduce [Model Cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about) and [Data Statements](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/data-statements/)
   to start addressing problematic bias in both machine learning models and the underlying data.
