This workshop provides participants the opportunity to explore [Sinopia][SINOPIA]'s Linked Data resources through a machine-learning lens. The workshop has four sections. 

1.  The first section will be an introduction to [Jupyter Notebooks][IPYNB],   
    harvesting RDF from [Sinopia's API][SINOPIA_API], and analyzing and visualizing the RDF using [Pandas][PANDAS]. 
1.  The second section takes the [Panda dataframes][PANDA_DF] from the first-section 
    and then build a custom [spaCy][SPACY] Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline for tagging descriptions with [FAST][FAST] subject headings. 
1.  The third section will use [HuggingFace][HF] transformers for NER and 
    summarization pipelines using [PyTorch][PYTRCH]. The final section focuses on broader machine learning challenges and will introduce participants to [Model Cards][MODELCRDS] and 
    [Data Statements][DATA_STMTS] for describing the work they did during the workshop.
