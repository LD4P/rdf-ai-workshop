    "\n",
    "> Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement,\n",
    "> medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their \n",
    "> usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation \n",
    "> detailing their performance characteristics. In > this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage \n",
    "> such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide\n",
    "> benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups \n",
    "> (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) \n",
    "> that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended \n",
    "> to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered \n",
    "> machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to \n",
    "> document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained \n",
    "> to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step \n",
    "> towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how \n",
    "> well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany \n",
    "> model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation."
